If you’re considering a web developer career, you can explore various paths within the field. Whether you have an eye for design or you enjoy scrutinizing a network for security flaws, web development has a specialization for you. Moreover, many web development careers feature a low barrier to entry.

In the following overview, we describe several careers in web development and explain the steps needed to start your journey in the field.

## Web Development Explained
What is web development? Professionals in this field create and maintain websites and apps. They cover an array of professional responsibilities, from coding and quality assurance testing to database management and security.

Dependent on a computer screen and a reliable internet connection, web developers can work in traditional office environments or remotely. However, these professionals often benefit from close collaboration with teammates.

## Web Development vs. Web Design
Web development and web design are adjacent fields, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Still, web development is the more technical field of the two, grounded in the coding that underlies every website and app.

## Types of Web Development
Front-end. Front-end development refers to site design and navigation (the “front end”).
Back-end. Back-end development deals with a website’s behind-the-scenes aspects, including site architecture, functionality, data analysis, security and storage.
Full-stack. Full-stack development is a catch-all specialization that covers many aspects of front- and back-end development.
Mobile. Given the ubiquity of smartphones, mobile application development—making apps for smartphones and tablets—has become an increasingly significant specialization.
